                <h3>Government Girls High School Mustimba Muzaffarabad AJK</h3>
                <p>Girls High School Mustimba has been completed in 2018 funded by <b>WAVE
                        Australia</b> and constructed by CDRS, the only girl’s school in the <b>15km radius</b>.
                    The school was established in 1982 but unfortunately it was destroyed by the 1992s flood. The girls
                    would sit on the bare and cold ground. In fact, lack of adequate educational facilities are the
                    primary
                    reason why most of the girls <br>
                    would drop out from high schools, despite AJK having one of the best enrolment
                    rates at the primary school level. In remote areas of Azad Kashmir, most of the
                    Schools have no buildings; Students are sitting under an open sky, during rains,
                    snow, and hard weather which affect them badly. <br>

                    The young girls of High School Mustimba, now have a roof over their heads and
                    chairs to sit on for their noble aim of education. They have a bright future ahead of them.</p>

            appropriate for the both hot and summer season with the cost of 1.34 Million. It has benefited 300 students.
            We handed over the school building to the Education Department, Government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and
            also established the local management committee that would be responsible to look after the school building.

            <p>We provide the shelter for the students especially girls to study in a comfortable environment and
                maximize the attendance of students and teachers. We also arranged the furniture and fixture for the
                Students and teachers to improve their educational engagement with respect. Our objective was to ensure
                that children especially girls get another chance to complete their education. The children who didn’t
                go to school after the earthquake due to demolish school building again join their school for getting
                their aims of life.</p>

                <h3>Government Higher Secondary School Kassian Halal, Muzafarabad AJK</h3>
                <p>Kassiyan Hallal, a village near Muzafarabad, has a population of about 5,000. In the winter heavy
                    snowfall cuts off the village from the main city and the isolated community further presents an
                    image of a desolate landscape. Consequently, children are locked up inside the houses. This is how
                    the problem starts – the students or the prospective leaders of the area are left with two choices:
                    either <br>
                    be forced to sit on the cold and wet floor of schools or skip classes. This dilemma is further
                    exacerbated, as the duration of snowfall also coincides with the end
                    of the year examinations. The area is fall among those areas that has highest primary</p>

                years</b> since
            the unfortunate earthquake of 2005.</p>
        <p class="data">There exists only one Science Higher Secondary School in the entire area of two union councils
            comprising
            approximately 80,000 individuals. Science Higher Secondary School Kassian Halal is also a coeducational
            institute with over 65% of the females. The school previously lacked basic shelter and furniture; students
            were forced to continue their education out in the open without any protection from the elements of nature.
            We have maintained the entire standard-essential by ERA and used the quality material that will be
            appropriate for the both hot and summer season with the cost of <b>2.17 Million</b>. It has benefited <b>320
                students</b>

            and handed over
